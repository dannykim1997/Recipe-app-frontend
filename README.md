## The Why

Oftentimes, when people look up a recipe online to cook, there are those who follow it to a T, but there are also those people who make their own adjustments. These adjustments will typically be kept track of by taking a note on a piece of paper or their phone. However, more often than not, it is done by taking a mental note. Remixcipe is a web application that will allow these home chefs to directly save these adjustments on their personalized cookbook.

## Main Features

- For those without an account, they can search through and view recipes as one would typically do on a standard recipe website.
