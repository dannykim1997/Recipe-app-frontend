# remixcipe

An online cookbook made by you, for you. 

## The Why

Oftentimes, when people look up a recipe online to cook, there are those who follow it to a T, but there are also those people who make their own adjustments. These adjustments will typically be kept track of by taking a note on a piece of paper or their phone. However, more often than not, it is done by taking a mental note. Remixcipe is a web application that will allow these home chefs to directly save these adjustments on their personalized cookbook.

## Main Features

- For those without an account, they can search through and view recipes as one would on a typical recipe website. 

- For those who do have an account and are logged in, they are able to add recipes to their cookbook.

- Once added to their cookbook, users have the ability to edit or remix their recipe. Once these adjustments are saved, the recipe will be as they've left it, the next time they want to cook the recipe again.

- Users also have the ability to manually add and create their own recipes.
